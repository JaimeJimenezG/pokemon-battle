# Pokemon Battle

This project is primarily a technical exploration and learning exercise to test and understand various technologies and frameworks. It's not intended as a production-ready application, but rather as a playground to experiment with Swift.

The project implements a simple Pokemon battle system where players can:
- Select a team of Pokemon
- Battle against an AI opponent (random AI)
